# Book Search Engine

## This is a node-based, very primitive search engine for finding books and building a reading list.

To use it, clone the repo, run npm install, and then npm start.

From there, you can search for books by typing in any keyword. A few keywords are reserved and will be interpreted as system commands.

L: shows your book list
S: saves your book list to your hard drive
H: shows a help menu
Q: quits the program
1-5: If a search has successfully completed, these numerals will allow you to add a book to your book list. (It's temporary unless or until you save.)
